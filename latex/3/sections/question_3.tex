\subsection{Observer}
We need to compute the gain matrix $L$ :
$$
L = \begin{pmatrix}
    l_1\\
    l_2\\
    l_3\\
    l_4
\end{pmatrix}
$$
The new dynamic matrix is given by $A_{obs} = A - LC$.\par
As previously, we will keep the same two dominant eigenvalues and determine the two other via the same method we have used for $K$.\par
Imposing that $(s - \lambda_1)(s - \lambda_2)$ is part of the decomposition, we get that the determinant of $A_{obs}$ is equal to :
$$
(s - \lambda_1)(s - \lambda_2)(s^2 + 2 \xi\omega_c s + \omega_c^2) = 0
$$
Since $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ are fixed, we only need to solve the equation of the second degree in $s$ in order to find the expressions of $\lambda_3$ and $\lambda_4$ as a function of $\xi$ and $\omega_c$.\par
The solutions of the equation are given by :
$$
\begin{cases}
    \lambda_3 = -\xi\omega_c - \omega_c\sqrt{\xi^2 - 1}\\
    \lambda_4 = -\xi\omega_c + \omega_c\sqrt{\xi^2 - 1}
\end{cases}
$$
As for the $K$ matrix, the values of $\xi$ and $\omega_c$ will be determined by simulations in the following sections. When these have been fixed, we will obtain the values of the 4 poles of $A_{obs}$ and will use the \texttt{place} function of Matlab to obtain the values $l_i$ of matrix $L$ associated with the eigenvalues.
