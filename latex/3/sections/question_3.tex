\subsection{Observer}
We need to compute the gain matrix $L$ :
$$
L = \begin{pmatrix}
    l_1\\
    l_2\\
    l_3\\
    l_4
\end{pmatrix}
$$
The new dynamic matrix is given by $A_{obs} = A - LC$.\par
As previously, we will keep the same two dominant eigenvalues and determine the two other via the same method we have used for $K$.\par
Imposing that $(s - \lambda_3)(s - \lambda_4)$ is part of the decomposition, we get that the determinant of $A_{obs}$ is equal to :
$$
(s - \lambda_3)(s - \lambda_4)(s^2 + 2 \xi\omega_c s + \omega_c^2) = 0
$$
Since $\lambda_3$ and $\lambda_4$ are fixed, we only need to solve the equation of the second degree in $s$ in order to find the expressions of $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ as a function of $\xi$ and $\omega_c$.\par
The solutions of the equation are given by :
$$
\begin{cases}
    \lambda_1 = -\xi\omega_c - \omega_c\sqrt{\xi^2 - 1}\\
    \lambda_2 = -\xi\omega_c + \omega_c\sqrt{\xi^2 - 1}
\end{cases}
$$
The poles of the observer are determined by taking the poles of the controller and moving them. To do this, the real parts of each pole are multiplied by a constant $\alpha$. In the case of poles $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$, this amounts to multiplying $w_c$ by $\alpha$.\par
We finally have :
$$
\begin{cases}
    \lambda_1 = -\xi\omega_c\alpha - \omega_c\alpha\sqrt{\xi^2 - 1}\\
    \lambda_2 = -\xi\omega_c\alpha + \omega_c\alpha\sqrt{\xi^2 - 1}\\
    \lambda_3 = \mathbb{R}(\lambda_3)\alpha + \mathbb{I}(\lambda_3)i\\
    \lambda_4 = \mathbb{R}(\lambda_4)\alpha + \mathbb{I}(\lambda_4)i
\end{cases}
$$
We then obtain the values $l_i$ of the matrix $L$ by using the \texttt{place} function of Matlab.
