\subsection{State feedback controller}
As the reference is 0, we need not care about $k_r$, so we can fix it to 0.\par
However, if the reference was to change, we could compute $k_r$, it would be nice. Some tests of a change in reference will be performed in this report.\par
In a first time, we only need to compute the gain matrix $K$.\par
In order not to apply a gain on the wind force, our matrix K is as follows :
$$
K = \begin{pmatrix}
    0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\ 
    g_1 & g_2 & g_3 & g_4
\end{pmatrix}
$$
The new dynamic matrix of the closed-loop system is $A_{CL} = A - BK$. Let's determine the eigenvalues of that matrix.\par
As we have a matrix of dimension $4$, we will make the approximation of the dominant poles. Indeed, we have, from the previous matrix $A$, the eigenvalues :
\begin{align*}
    \lambda_1 &= \num{-5 + 8.6603i}\\
    \lambda_2 &= \num{-5 - 8.6603i}\\
    \lambda_3 &= \num{-0.0628 + 6.2828i}\\
    \lambda_4 &= \num{-0.0628 - 6.2828i}
\end{align*}
We can see that $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ are about $100$ times bigger than the last two, and so we do not need to work on them. Those two will therefore remain in $A_{CL}$.\par
Imposing that $(s - \lambda_1)(s - \lambda_2)$ is part of the decomposition, we get that the determinant of $A_{CL}$ is equal to :
$$
(s - \lambda_1)(s - \lambda_2)(s^2 + 2 \xi\omega_c s + \omega_c^2) = 0
$$
Since $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ are fixed, we only need to solve the equation of the second degree in $s$ in order to find the expressions of $\lambda_3$ and $\lambda_4$ as a function of $\xi$ and $\omega_c$.\par
The solutions of the equation are given by :
$$
\begin{cases}
    \lambda_3 = -\xi\omega_c - \omega_c\sqrt{\xi^2 - 1}\\
    \lambda_4 = -\xi\omega_c + \omega_c\sqrt{\xi^2 - 1}
\end{cases}
$$
The values of $\xi$ and $\omega_c$ will be determined by simulations in the following sections. When these have been fixed, we will obtain the values of the 4 poles of $A_{CL}$. Then we will just have to use the \texttt{place} function of Matlab to obtain the values $g_i$ of matrix $K$ associated with the eigenvalues.
